# Particle-Shooter
A simple projectile shooter game that I developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. I used Visual Studio Code for my environment.  

When I first started learning web development, I was able to get text and images displaying in a browser, but when it came to developing interactive games and web pages -- I got frustrated and felt like I really wasn't made out to be a web developer. 

Through much trial and error, I eventually started putting the pieces of the game development puzzle together. I spent MONTHS studying and analyzing other developers canvas pieces, while also taking Khan Academy math courses to truly understand how math and programming work in tandem together to produce a fully functional game. I realized that game development wasn't really that hard.
